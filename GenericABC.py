Artificial bee colony used to optimize parameters given any range of parameter values, their types, and a fitness function. The fitness
function will be passed to the constructor and called when each individual bee must generate a fitness score for its current set of 
values that it contains.
Was meant to be a wrapper class for the ecnet neural network.
